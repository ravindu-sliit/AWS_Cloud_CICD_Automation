# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

### Three Iron Laws of Code Debugging

1. **No goto_definition = No modify** — Don't change code you haven't navigated to its definition
2. **No find_references = No refactor** — Don't refactor without knowing all usage sites
3. **No get_diagnostics = No claim fixed** — Don't claim a fix without verifying zero new diagnostics

## Investigation Document Protocol

The investigation document (`docs/investigations/{date}-{topic}.md`) is the persistent, cross-session record of a debugging effort. Create one at the start of every non-trivial debug session using `skills/omk-debugging/investigation-template.md`.

### Three-Level Evidence System

| Level | Label | Meaning | Mutability |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|
| 🔒 L0 | Machine Facts | Command output, code analysis, API responses, experiment results | **Immutable** — cannot be overridden except by stronger L0 evidence |
| 👤 L1 | Human Observations | User-reported operations and phenomena | **Protected** — need L0 evidence + documented rationale to challenge |
| 🤖 L2 | Agent Inferences | AI deductions, hypotheses, analysis conclusions | **Mutable** — can be revised freely; mark old entry ~~struck~~, keep original |

### Section Update Rules

| Section | Update Mode | Rule |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Status Overview | **Overwrite** | Refresh after every Stage completion — must reflect current state at all times |
| Evidence Table | **Append-only** | Never delete or edit existing entries; add new rows only |
| Investigation Tree | **Overwrite** | Update branch statuses (⬜→✅/❌) as investigation progresses |
| Decision Log | **Append-only** | Superseded decisions stay; mark status as "❌ 被 D{n} 取代" |
| Experiment Log | **Append-only** | Each experiment gets a unique EXP-{n} ID for cross-reference |
| Ruled Out | **Append-only** | Eliminated directions stay permanently to prevent re-investigation |
| Timeline | **Append-only** | Chronological milestones, never rewritten |

## Anti-regression Rules

These rules prevent new sessions from undoing prior investigation progress:

1. **Overturning 🔒 L0 facts**: Requires stronger L0 evidence (new command output or experiment). Must record both old and new evidence in the Evidence Table with explicit comparison.
2. **Challenging 👤 L1 observations**: Requires L0 evidence that contradicts the observation. Must document the challenge rationale in the Timeline.
3. **Revising 🤖 L2 inferences**: Free to revise. Mark the old inference ~~struck~~ (do not delete). New inference must note "取代 I{n}".
4. **Decision Log**: Rejected decisions must include rejection rationale. New sessions must NOT re-attempt a rejected approach unless new L0 evidence invalidates the rejection reason.
5. **Ruled Out**: Eliminated investigation directions must NOT be re-investigated unless new L0 evidence emerges that was unavailable when the direction was ruled out.

## Tool Decision Matrix

| Bug Type | Tool Sequence | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Compile/type error | `get_diagnostics` → `goto_definition` → `get_hover` | Diagnostics pinpoint error; definition shows context; hover reveals types |
| Wrong behavior | `search_symbols` → `find_references` → `goto_definition` | Find the symbol, trace all callers, read implementation |
| Unknown codebase | `get_document_symbols` → `goto_definition` → `get_hover` | Map file structure, navigate to definitions, understand types |
| Refactor broke something | `find_references` → `get_diagnostics` → `search_symbols` | Find all usage sites, check for new errors, locate related symbols |
| Test failure | `get_diagnostics` → `search_symbols` → `find_references` | Check compiler errors first, find test subject, trace dependencies |

**When to use grep instead:** Only for searching comments, string literals, config values, or non-code files.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

**Step -1: Build Architectural Context (MANDATORY — do NOT skip)**

Before looking at any specific code, build a map of the system around the bug. This step solves the "structural blindness" problem — LLMs process code as text and cannot see dependency graphs, call chains, or architectural boundaries without explicit navigation.

1. Run `generate_codebase_overview` to get the project's high-level module structure
2. For the bug's core symbol(s), run `find_references` to discover all callers and usage sites
3. For the bug's file(s), run `get_document_symbols` to understand internal structure
4. Produce an **Architectural Context** summary:

```
Architectural Context:
- Module: [where this code sits in the system architecture]
- Upstream callers: [who calls the buggy code — list file:function]
- Downstream dependencies: [what the buggy code depends on]
- Cross-module impact: [which other modules could be affected by a fix]
- Hidden dependencies: [files with no semantic overlap but architectural connection]
```

Why this is mandatory: CodeCompass research (258 trials) showed that dependency graph navigation achieves 99.4% architectural coverage on hidden dependencies vs 76.2% without (+23.2pp). Agents only explore dependencies voluntarily 42% of the time — when skipped, performance equals the no-tool baseline. This step must be forced, not optional.

**Step 0: Check Past Episodes**
- Read `knowledge/episodes.md` for similar past bugs
- Past mistakes often repeat — check before investigating from scratch

**Step 0.5: Classify Failure Type (Failure Classification)**

Before diving into investigation, classify the failure to guide your approach. Pick the most likely category:

| Category | Description | Typical Signal |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Logic/Semantic Error | Code logic is wrong | Test fails, wrong output |
| Environment/Config Error | Environment, config, or dependency issue | Works locally, fails in CI |
| Concurrency/Timing Error | Race condition, timing dependency | Intermittent failure |
| Invalid Invocation | Tool/API call malformed or missing args | Schema error, 400 response |
| Misinterpretation of Output | Acted on wrong assumption about a return value | Downstream logic wrong |
| Intent–Plan Misalignment | Solving the wrong problem | Fix doesn't address user's actual issue |
| Plan Adherence Failure | Skipped required steps or did unplanned actions | Expected step not executed |
| Invention of New Information | Hallucinated data not in trace/tool output | References nonexistent variable/file |
| Under-specified Intent | Not enough information to proceed | Need more context from user |

Write your classification into the Diagnostic Evidence (Step 6). If unsure, pick the top 2 candidates and investigate both.

**Step 1: Run get_diagnostics First**
- Run `get_diagnostics` on the failing file(s) to get compiler errors, warnings, hints
- This gives you the exact error locations and types — far more precise than reading logs

**Step 2: Use search_symbols to Find Relevant Code**
- Use `search_symbols` to locate the function/class/variable involved in the error
- Follow up with `goto_definition` to read the actual implementation
- Use `find_references` to understand all callers and usage sites

**Step 3: Read Error Messages Carefully**
- Don't skip past errors or warnings
- They often contain the exact solution
- Read stack traces completely
- Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

**Step 4: Reproduce Consistently**
- Can you trigger it reliably?
- What are the exact steps?
- Does it happen every time?
- If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

**Step 5: Check Recent Changes**
- What changed that could cause this?
- Git diff, recent commits
- New dependencies, config changes
- Environmental differences
- **If this is a regression** (it used to work, now it doesn't): use the Git Bisect flow in `reference.md` to pinpoint the exact commit that introduced the bug

**Step 6: Gather Diagnostic Evidence**

You MUST produce a **Diagnostic Evidence** summary before moving to Phase 2:

```
Diagnostic Evidence:
- failure_type: [category from Step 0.5 classification]
- get_diagnostics: [what errors/warnings were found]
- search_symbols: [what symbols were located]
- find_references: [what callers/usage sites were found]
- get_hover: [what type information was revealed]
- key_variables:
  - var_name: [variable name]
    expected: [expected value at this point]
    actual: [actual value observed]
    location: [file:line where divergence occurs]
  - ...
- Root cause hypothesis: [your conclusion based on above]
```

Without this evidence, you cannot proceed.

**Step 7: Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):

BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:
```
For EACH component boundary:
  - Log what data enters component
  - Log what data exits component
  - Verify environment/config propagation
  - Check state at each layer

Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
THEN investigate that specific component
```

**Step 8: Trace Data Flow**

WHEN error is deep in call stack:
- Use `goto_definition` to navigate to the error source
- Use `find_references` to trace callers backward
- Where does bad value originate?
- Keep tracing up until you find the source
- Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - Use `search_symbols` to find similar patterns
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Run get_diagnostics Before Fix (baseline)**
   - Record current diagnostics count and details
   - This is your "before" snapshot

2. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - MUST have before fixing

3. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

4. **Run get_diagnostics After Fix (verify)**
   - Compare with baseline: new diagnostics must be 0
   - All original diagnostics should be resolved or unchanged
   - If new diagnostics appeared, your fix introduced problems — revert

5. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?

5.5. **Self-Explanation (Rubber Duck Verification)**
   After verifying the fix works, explain in natural language:
   - **Root cause**: What exactly was wrong and why?
   - **Fix logic**: Why does this fix resolve the root cause?
   - **Side effects**: Could this fix introduce new problems? Check against the Architectural Context from Step -1.
   
   If you discover a logical contradiction while explaining → STOP, return to Phase 3 and re-verify your hypothesis. The act of explaining often reveals flawed reasoning that testing alone misses.

6. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 7 below)**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

7. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   **STOP and question fundamentals:**
   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
   - Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

   **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

8. **Post-Fix Review**
   After the fix is verified and working:
   - Compare the original buggy code vs the fixed code — is the fix minimal?
   - Check: did the fix introduce any code smells (duplication, magic numbers, missing error handling)?
   - Check: does the fix need defensive programming at other call sites? (Refer to Architectural Context from Step -1)
   - Write a one-line summary for `knowledge/episodes.md` if this is a new bug pattern
   - Update the investigation document: set **Status Overview** to 🟢 Resolved, record final root cause and fix in **Decision Log**

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**
- **Using grep to find code instead of search_symbols/find_references**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.7)

## Your Human Partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |
| "I'll just grep for it" | grep is text matching. Use LSP tools for semantic code analysis. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | get_diagnostics, search_symbols, find_references, reproduce, gather evidence | Diagnostic Evidence produced |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Pre/post get_diagnostics, create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, zero new diagnostics |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.
